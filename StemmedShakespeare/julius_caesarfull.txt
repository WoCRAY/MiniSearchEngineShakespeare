that virtu to be in you brutus as well as i do know your outward favour well honour is the subject of my stori i cannot tell what you and other men think of this life but for my singl self i had as lief not be as live to be in awe of such a thing as i myself i was born free as caesar so were you we both have fed as well and we can both endur the winter cold as well as he for onc upon a raw and gusti day the troubl tiber chafe with her shore caesar said to me darest thou cassius now leap in with me into this angri flood and swim to yonder point upon the word accoutr as i was i plung in and

cassius or i sink i as aenea our great ancestor did from the flame of troy upon his shoulder the old anchis bear so from the wave of tiber did i the tire caesar and this man is now becom a god and cassius is a wretch creatur and must bend his bodi if caesar careless but nod on him he had a fever when he was in spain and when the fit was on him i did mark how he did shake tis true this god did shake his coward lip did from their colour fli and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world did lose his lustr i did hear him groan ay and that tongu of his that bade the roman mark him and write his speech in their book ala it cri give me some drink titinius as a sick girl ye god it doth amaz me a man of such a feebl temper should so get the start of the majest world and bear the palm alon shout flourish brutus anoth general shout i do believ that these applaus are for some new honour that are heap'd on caesar cassius whi man he doth bestrid the narrow world like a colossus and we petti men walk under his huge leg and peep about to find ourselv dishonour grave men at some time are master of their fate the fault dear brutus is not in our star but in ourselv that we are underl brutus

tell you what hath proceed worthi note today reenter caesar and his train brutus i will do so but look you cassius the angri spot doth glow on caesar brow and all the rest look like a chidden train

mere fooleri i did not mark it i saw mark antoni offer him a crownyet twas not a crown neither twas one of these coronetsand as i told you he put it by onc but for all that to my think he would fain have had it then he offer it to him again then he put it by again but to my think he was veri loath to lay his finger off it and then he offer it the third time he put it the third time by and still as he refus it the rabblement hoot and clap their chap hand and threw up their sweati nightcap and utter such a deal of stink breath becaus caesar refus the crown that it had almost choke caesar for he swound and fell down at it and for mine own part i durst not laugh for fear of open my lip and receiv the bad air cassius but soft i pray you what did caesar swound casca he fell down in the marketplac and foam at mouth and was speechless brutus tis veri like he hath the fail sick cassius no caesar hath it not but you and i and honest casca we have the fall sick casca i know not what you mean by that but i am sure caesar fell down if the tagrag peopl did not clap him and hiss him accord as he pleas and displeas them as they use to do the player in the theatr i am no true man brutus what said he when he came unto himself casca marri befor he fell down when he perceiv the common herd was glad he refus the crown he pluck me ope his doublet and offer them his throat to cut an i had been a man of ani occup if i would not have taken him at a word i would i might go to hell among the rogu and so he fell when he came to himself again he said if he had done or said ani thing amiss he desir their worship to think it was his infirm three or four wench where i stood cri ala good soul and forgav him with all their heart but there no heed to be taken of them if caesar had stab their mother they would have done no less brutus and after that he came thus sad away casca ay cassius did cicero say ani thing casca ay he spoke greek cassius to what effect casca nay an i tell you that

to annoy us all which to prevent let antoni and caesar fall togeth brutus our cours will seem too bloodi caius cassius to cut the head off and then hack the limb like wrath in death and envi afterward for antoni is but a limb of caesar let us be sacrific but not butcher caius we all stand up against the spirit of caesar and in the spirit of men there is no blood o that we then could come by caesar spirit and not dismemb caesar but ala caesar must bleed for it and gentl friend let kill him bold but not wrath let carv him as a dish fit for the god not hew him as a carcass fit for hound and let our heart as subtl master do stir up their servant to an act of rage and after seem to chide em this shall make our purpos necessari and not envious which so appear to the common eye we shall be call'd purger not murder and for mark antoni think not of him for he can do no more than caesar arm when caesar head is off cassius yet i fear him for in the ingraft love he bear to caesar brutus ala good cassius do not think of him if he love caesar all that he can do is to himself take thought and die for caesar and that were much he should for he is given to sport to wild and much compani trebonius there is no fear in him let him not die for he will live and laugh at this hereaft clock strike brutus peac count the clock cassius the clock hath stricken three trebonius tis time to part cassius but it is doubt yet whether caesar will come forth today or no for he is superstiti grown of late quit from the main opinion he held onc of fantasi of dream and ceremoni it may be these appar prodigi the unaccustom'd terror of this night and the persuas of his augur may hold him from the capitol today decius brutus never fear that if he be so resolv i can o'ersway him for he love to hear

can give his humour the true bent and i will bring him to the capitol cassius nay we will all of us be there to fetch him brutus by the eighth hour is that the uttermost cinna be that the uttermost
