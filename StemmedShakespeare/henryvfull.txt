germani between the flood of sala and of elb where charl the great have subdu the saxon there left behind and settl certain french who hold in disdain the german women for some dishonest manner of their life establish'd then this law to wit no femal should be inheritrix in saliqu land which saliqu as i said twixt elb and sala is at this day in germani call'd meisen then doth it well appear that
