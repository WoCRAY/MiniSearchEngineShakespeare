sonnet lxxi sonnet lxxi no longer mourn for me when i am dead then you shall hear the sur sullen bell give warn to the world that i am fled from this vile world with vilest worm to dwell nay if you read this line rememb not the hand that writ it for i love you so that i in your sweet thought would be forgot if think on me then should make you woe o if i say you look upon this vers when i perhap compound am with clay do not so much as my poor name rehears but let your love even with my life decay lest the wise world should look into your moan and mock you with me after i am gone
